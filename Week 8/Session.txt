Drone
- A drone is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously using software-controlled flight plans in its embedded systems, that work in conjunction with onboard sensors and a global positioning system (GPS).
- UAVs were most often associated with the military. 
- Drones are now also used in a range of civilian roles, including the following:
	- Trafic monitoring
	- Weather monitoring
- Remote sensing
	- Satelite
	- Plane
	- UAV
- Plane > Satelite in data collection
	
AI
- AI immitates human's senses and behaviour.
- AI application
	- Machine Vision - Differentiate objects seen by camera.
	- Robotics
	- Machine Learning - Deep learning & Predictive Analysis
